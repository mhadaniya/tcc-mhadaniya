  abstract = {The amount of data of all kinds available electronically has increased
	dramatically in recent years. The data resides in different forms,
	ranging from unstructured data in file systems to highly structured
	in relational database systems. Data is accessible through a variety
	of interfaces including Web browsers, database query languages, application-specific
	interfaces, or data exchange formats. Some of this data is raw data,
	e.g. images or sound. Some of it has structure even if the structure
	is often implicit, and not as rigid or regular as that found in standard
	database systems. Sometimes the structure exists but has to be extracted
	from the data. Sometimes also it exists but we prefer to ignore it
	for certain purposes such as browsing. We call here semi-structured
	data this data that is (from a particular viewpoint) neither raw
	data nor strictly typed, i.e., not table-oriented as in a relational
	model or sorted-graph as in object databases...},

  abstract = {The Internet presents a huge amount of useful information which is
	usually formatted for its users, which makes it difficult to extract
	relevant data from various sources. Therefore, the availability of
	robust, flexible Information Extraction (IE) systems that transform
	the Web pages into program-friendly structures such as a relational
	database will become a great necessity. Although many approaches
	for data extraction from Web pages have been developed, there has
	been limited effort to compare such tools. Unfortunately, in only
	a few cases can the results generated by distinct tools be directly
	compared since the addressed extraction tasks are different. This
	paper surveys the major Web data extraction approaches and compares
	them in three dimensions: the task domain, the automation degree,
	and the techniques used. The criteria of the first dimension explain
	why an IE system fails to handle some Web sites of particular structures.
	The criteria of the second dimension classify IE systems based on
	the techniques used. The criteria of the third dimension measure
	the degree of automation for IE systems. We believe these criteria
	provide qualitatively measures to evaluate various IE approaches.},

  abstract = {With the huge amount of information available online, the World Wide
	Web is a fertile area for data mining research. The Web mining research
	is at the cross road of research from several research communities,
	such as database, information retrieval, and within AI, especially
	the sub-areas of machine learning and natural language processing.
	However, there is a lot of confusions when comparing research efforts
	from different point of views. In this paper, we survey the research
	in the area of Web mining, point out some confusions regarded the
	usage of the term Web mining and suggest three Web mining categories.
	Then we situate some of the research with respect to these three
	categories. We also explore the connection between the Web mining
	categories and the related agent paradigm. For the survey, we focus
	on representation issues, on the process, on the learning algorithm,
	and on the application of the recent works as the criteria. We conclude
	the paper with some research issues.},

  abstract = {Natural language technologies have long been envisioned to play a
	crucial role in developing a Semantic Web. Textual content's significance
	on the Web has increased with the rise of Web 2.0 and mass participation
	in content generation. Yet, natural language technologies face great
	challenges in dealing with Web content's heterogeneity: key among
	these is domain and task adaptation. To address this challenge, the
	authors consider the problem of semantically annotating Wikipedia.
	Specifically, they investigate a method for dealing with domain and
	task adaptation of semantic taggers in cases where parallel text
	and metadata are available. By creating a semantic mapping among
	vocabularies from two sources: Wikipedia and the original annotated
	corpus, they improve their tagger on Wikipedia. Moreover, by applying
	their tagger and mapping between sources, they significantly extend
	the metadata currently available in the DBpedia collection. This
	article is part of a special issue on Natural Language Processing
	and the Web.},

	of relevance to a user's query, from within a corpus or collection

	fact a hard problem because of the subtleties introduced by the use
	of natural language in both documents and in queries. The automatic
	processing of natural language clearly represents significant potential
	for improving information retrieval tasks because of the dominance
	of the natural language medium on the whole IR task. Information
	extraction is also fundamentally about dealing with natural language
	albeit for a different function. It is thus of interest to the IE
	community to see how a related task, perhaps the most-related task,
	IR, has managed to use the same NLP base technology in its development
	so far. This is an especially valid comparison to make since IR has
	been the subject of research and development and has been delivering
	working solutions for many decades whereas IE ...},
